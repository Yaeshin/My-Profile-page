# My profile roadmap

What would I like my profile page to look like ? Let's dive into it.

## Pages

First of all, it should include a navbar to navigate easily between pages. 

> ![navbar](img/navbar.png)

A profile page should be complete but not overloaded. As such it should contain all important information and be precise without going on and on.
I feel like the following pages are must-have :

- An introduction to myself
- My skills
- My experience
- My portfolio
- My contacts

A profile could include more but I don't feel it necessary.

### Introduction to myself

On this page there would be a short description of me such as :

> My name is Celestin, I am a freelance junior developer, currently working on project A. 

add to that a list of passions and other stuff.

### Skills

The skill page would have a visual representation of my current skills from beginner to master on each programming language I know and each software I can use to some extent.
It may also include which technologies I am interested in.

### Experience

This would act like a CV where I would put where I worked and what type of work I did there, it would also include the technologies used.
A timeline with under and over text areas linking to the timeline would be the design.

### Portfolio

It would probably be an ordered list sorted by time or by how proud I am of them with a description of what it is and when it was developed.
