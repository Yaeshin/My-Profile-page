# My profile roadmap

What would I like my profile page to look like ? Let's dive into it.

## Pages

First of all, it should include a navbar to navigate easily between pages. 

> ![navbar](img/navbar.png)

A profile page should be complete but not overloaded. As such it should contain all important information and be precise without going on and on.
I feel like the following pages are must-have :

- An introduction to myself
- My skills
- My experience
- My portfolio
- My contacts

A profile could include more but I don't feel it necessary.

### Introduction to myself

On this page there would be a short description of me such as :

> My name is Celestin, I am a freelance junior developer, currently working on project A. 

add to that a list of passions and other stuff.

### Skills

The skill page would have a visual representation of my current skills from beginner to master on each programming language I know and each software I can use to some extent.
It may also include which technologies I am interested in.

### Experience

This would act like a CV where I would put where I worked and what type of work I did there, it would also include the technologies used.
A timeline with under and over text areas linked to the timeline would be the design.

### Portfolio

It would probably be an ordered list sorted by time or by how satisfied I am of them with an image, a description of what it is and when it was developed.
If some of those projects are public, it would also link to the public repository.

### Contacts

The contacts wouldn't be a separate page but would be on the footer to be accessible at any time.

## Inspirations

There are millions of websites that one can get inspiration from, here are a few that I like :

- https://itssharl.ee/fr
- https://p5aholic.me/
- https://brittanychiang.com/
- https://bonhomme.lol/
- https://tamalsen.dev/

There are many more that you can discover with just one search.

## Me, not an other

> What would make me stand out from all the others out there ?

That is a very difficult question to answer. I don't think there is a right answer to this as everyone is unique. It all depends on whether or not I can resonate with the person visiting my page. If they appreciate the design, the content, if they are interested in the story. There are too many factors to take into account to answer this question.
